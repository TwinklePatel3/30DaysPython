x1,x2,y1,y2 = 2,6,2,10
slope_2 = ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1))
#formula = d = âˆš((x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2)
euclidean_distance = ((x2 - x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
print("slope",slope_2)
print("Euclidean_distance",euclidean_distance)

# 10. Compare the slopes in tasks 8 and 9.
print(slope_1 == slope_2)

# 11. Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is going to be 0.
x = -3
print("y =",x**2+6*x+9)

# 12. Find the length of 'python' and 'dragon' and make a falsy comparison statement.
len_python = len('python')
len_dragon = len("dragon")
print(len_python != len_dragon)

# 13. Use and operator to check if 'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'
print("'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'","on" in "python" and "on" in "dragon")

# 14. I hope this course is not full of jargon. 
#   Use in operator to check if jargon is in the sentence.
print("jargon" in "I hope this course is not full of jargon")

# 15. There is no 'on' in both dragon and python
print("There is no 'on' in both dragon and python","on" not in "python" and "on" not in "dragon")

# 16. Find the length of the text python and convert the value to float and convert it to string
print(float(len_python),str(len_python))

# 17. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check if a number is even or not using python?
num=10
is_Even = num % 2 == 0
print(is_Even)

# 18. Check if the floor division of 7 by 3 is equal to the int converted value of 2.7.
print(7//3 == int(2.7))

# 19. Check if type of '10' is equal to type of 10
print(type('10')==type(10))

# 20. Check if int('9.8') is equal to 10
# print(int('9.8') == 10) #Error

# 21. Writ a script that prompts the user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?
#       Enter hours: 40
#       Enter rate per hour: 28
#       Your weekly earning is 1120

#       Enter number of years you have lived: 100
#       You have lived for 3153600000 seconds.
second_per_year = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
num_of_yr = input("Enter number of years you have lived: ")
print("You have lived for",second_per_year * int(num_of_yr),"seconds")
